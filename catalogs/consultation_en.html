          <td class="help">Some data can, technically, be created anew at any time, as is the case with scientific experiments or digitised versions of analog objects (as long as the originals are still there and in good shape). However, this can consume a considerable amount of time and cost. With respect to  long-term preservation, the effort of re-creation has to be weighed up against the effort of long-term preservation.<br />

          Other data cannot be collected or created anew. Examples are all kinds of "time stamped" observations, be they from social science,  astrophysics or any other discipline. Observations represent a certain phenomenon at a certain time and / or place and are therefore not repeatable. Their value for re-use as well as the loss in case of failed preservation is much higher than that of reproducible data.</td>

          <td class="help">The handling and processing of <b>personal data</b> is regulated by law. The uniform application throughout the EU is based on the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>. It allows for regulatory leeway at national level.
            <br />
          In Germany, this is regulated by the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bdsg_2018/">Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG)</a>, and for universities, the individual data protection laws of the individual federal states apply, e.g. the <a href="https://recht.nrw.de/lmi/owa/br_text_anzeigen?v_id=3520071121100436275">data protection law of North Rhine-Westphalia (DSG NRW)</a>.
            <br />
          The european GDPR defines personal data as all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (Art. 4(1) GPDR).
            <br />
          A person is <b>identified</b> if it is clearly identifiable to whom the data belongs.
            <br />
          A person becomes <b>identifiable</b> if it can be identified by means of additional information.
            <br />

          <td class="help">Data or software can be subject to intellectual or industrial property rights. Applicable laws differ broadly even within EU.
            <br />
          According to the German copyright law (UrhG) works of literature, scholarship and the arts that can be regarded as a “personal intellectual creation” are protected by copyright. Copyright protection expires 70 years after the death of the copyright holder.
            <br />
          Mere data, e.g. measured data or survey data, and metadata (except in some cases descriptive metadata) are not protected by copyright.
            <br />
          § 2 of the UrhG lists the following kinds of protected works (list is not concluded):
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>linguistic works such as written works, speeches and computer programs</li>
              <li>works of music</li>
              <li>pantomimic works including works of the art of dance</li>
              <li>works or the fine arts including works of architecture and the applied arts as well as sketches of such works</li>
              <li>works of photography and cinematography</li>
              <li>descriptions and illustrations of scholarly or technical nature such as drawings, plans, maps, sketches, tables and three-dimensional represenations</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
          According to § 3, copyright is also applicable to translations and other modifications or adaptions of a work if they are individual intellectual creations of the editor.
            <br />
          Finally, according to § 4 copyright also extents to collected editions and database works. Collected editions are “collections of work, data or other independent elements that are individual intellectual creations based on the selection and arrangement of the elements”. Database works are defined as “collected editions, the elements of which are arranged in a systematic or methodical way and can be accessed individually by electronic means or in other ways”.
